      <description>Description Recently, we have seen a resurgence of Excel-based malicous office documents. Howerver, instead of using VBA-style macros, they are using older style Excel 4 macros. This changes our approach to analyzing these documents, requiring a slightly different set of tools. In this challenge, you&#39;ll get hands-on with two documents that use Excel 4.0 macros to perform anti-analysis and download the next stage of the attack.Challenge Link : https://cyberdefenders.</description>
