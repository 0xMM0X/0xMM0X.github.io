      <description>Ryuk is a ransomware which encrypts its victim&amp;rsquo;s files and asks for a ransom via bitcoin to release the original files. It is has been observed being used to attack companies or professional environments. Cybersecurity experts figured out that Ryuk and Hermes ransomware shares pieces of codes. Hermes is commodity ransomware that has been observed for sale on dark-net forums and used by multiple threat actors.

      <description>Description Company X has contacted you to perform forensics work on a recent incident that occurred. One of their employees had received an e-mail from a co-worker that pointed to a PDF file. Upon opening, the employee did not notice anything; however, they recently had unusual activity in their bank account.The initial theory is that a user received an e-mail, containing an URL leading to a forged PDF document.Opening that document in Acrobat Reader triggers a malicious Javascript that initiates a sequence of actions to take over the victim&#39;s system.</description>
