      <description>Description Company X has contacted you to perform forensics work on a recent incident that occurred. One of their employees had received an e-mail from a co-worker that pointed to a PDF file. Upon opening, the employee did not notice anything; however, they recently had unusual activity in their bank account.The initial theory is that a user received an e-mail, containing an URL leading to a forged PDF document.Opening that document in Acrobat Reader triggers a malicious Javascript that initiates a sequence of actions to take over the victim&#39;s system.</description>
