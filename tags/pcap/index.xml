      <description>Description We are hosting a gallery website for public arts, we faced slowness issues however our deployment team decided to utilize HTTP/2 as when scrolling a webpage with multiple images, a web browser can cancel images that fall outside the viewport, meaning that images entering it can load faster. Everything went smoothly in our testing environment but after going live with the new protocol suddenly everything stopped working. We were able to capture the traffic from the web server, can you help us to figure out what happened?</description>
